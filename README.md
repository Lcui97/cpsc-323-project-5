This program takes lightly optimized TAC instructions and converts them to a MIPS .asm file

Note that test cases are hard coded in main.py under the "input_path" variable. Replace the value of this variable in order to run other test cases. It will run with "testCase1.txt" by default. 

This program assumes that you have access to a linux command terminal with the latest version of Python. 

To run:

python main.py
